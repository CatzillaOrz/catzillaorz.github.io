However, many critics argue that ethanol is not a good replacement for gasoline for several reasons.</p>
<p>First, the increased use of ethanol fuel would not help to solve one of the biggest environmental problems caused by gasoline use: global warming. Like gasoline, ethanol releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere when it is burned for fuel, and carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas: it helps trap heat in the atmosphere. Thus, ethanol offers no environmental advantage over gasoline.</p>
<p>Second, the production of significant amounts of ethanol would dramatically reduce the amount of plants available for uses other than fuel. For example, much of the corn now grown in the United States is used to feed farm animals such as cows and chickens. It is estimated that if ethanol were used to satisfy just 10 percent of the fuel needs in the United States, more than 60 percent of the corn currently grown in the United States would have to be used to produce ethanol. If most of the corn were used to produce ethanol, a substantial source of food for animals would disappear.</p>
<p>Third, ethanol fuel will never be able to compete with gasoline on price. Although the prices of ethanol and gasoline for the consumer are currently about the same, this is only because of the help in the form of tax subsidies given to ethanol producers by the United States government. These tax subsidies have cost the United States government over $11 billion in the past 30 years. If the United States government were to stop helping the producers in this way, the price of ethanol would increase greatly.</p>

</ol>
<p>来代替 汽油。然而,很多评论家认为一些原因使得乙醇燃料不是良好的汽油替代品。</p>
<p>首先,使用汽油带来的最大的问题之一是全球变暖,而对于乙醇燃料使用的增加并不能 解决 这个问题。同汽油一样,乙醇燃烧后向大气释放二氧化碳,而二氧化碳是温室气体。它会 保 持大气层内的温度。因而,相对于汽油来<br>说,乙醇并没有环保优势。</p>
<p>第二,乙醇产品的大量增加会导致用于其他目的作物数量减少。比如,在美国很多的玉 米都 是用来作动物饲料来喂养牛和鸡。可以推测,如果乙醇只满足美国对燃料需要的 10%, 那 么美国就要用现在玉米产量的 60%用来制<br>造乙醇燃料。如果把玉米产量的大部分用来生 产 乙醇燃料的话,那么家畜主要的食物来源就不复存在了。</p>
<p>第三,乙醇燃料燃料在价格上永远无法与汽油竞争。虽然目前对消费者来说,乙醇燃料 和汽 油的相差无几,但是只是因为美国政府以税收补贴的形式补助乙醇燃料制造商。这个税 收补 贴在过去的三十年花掉了美国政府<br>110 亿美元。如果美国政府停止以这种形式帮助制 造商, 那么乙醇燃料的价格会大幅升高。</p>

<p>Ethanol actually is a good alternative to gasoline although you just read three reasons why it is not a good alternative. Not one of these three reasons is convincing.</p>
<p>First, the increased use of ethanol will not add to global warming. It is true that when ethanol is burned, it releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. But as you read, ethanol was often made from plants such as corn. Well, the process of growing the plants counteracts this release of carbon dioxide. Let me explain. Every growing plant absorbs carbon dioxide from the air as a part of its nutrition. So, growing plants for ethanol production actually removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Second, large scale production of ethanol does not have to reduce the source of food for animals. That is because we can produce ethanol using cellulose. Cellulose is the main component of plants’ cell walls, and you find most cellulose in those parts of plants that are not eaten by animals. So, since we can produce ethanol from the plant parts that are not eaten, the amount of animals feed that is available will not be reduced.</p>
<p>Third, in the future, ethanol will be able to compete with gasoline in term of price. It is true that the government subsidies make up ethanol is cheaper than it would normally be, but this support would not always be needed. Once enough people start buying ethanol, ethanol producers will increase their production of ethanol. Generally, increased production of a product leads to a drop in its price, so the price of ethanol will go down as more of it becomes available. Study shows that if ethanol production could be three times greater than it is now, the cost of producing a unit of ethanol would drop by forty percent.</p>

<ol>
<li>参考译文</li>
</ol>
<p>虽然阅读部分说乙醇燃料不是汽油很好的代替品,但是事实上是可以很好代替汽油的。<br>阅读 部分给出的三个理由都是没有说服力的。 首先,提高对乙醇燃料的使用不会导致全球变暖。诚然,燃烧乙醇燃料的时候是会向空<br>气中 排放二氧化碳。但是,就像在阅读部分看到的,通常来说乙醇燃料是由玉米之类的作物制 造 的。恩,这些作物生长的过程中可以抵消掉乙醇燃料燃烧所释放的二氧化碳的。我来解释 一 下。所有作物在生长的过程中都会吸收空气中的二氧化碳作为养料。所以,为制造乙醇燃 料 而种植的作物事实上可以吸收乙醇燃料排放到空气中的二氧化碳。<br>第二,大量生产乙醇燃料不会减少畜牧业的饲料供应。这是因为我们用纤维素制造乙 醇燃料。 纤维素是植物细胞壁的主要组成成分,而且多数作物富含纤维素的部分都是家畜不 食用的。 所以,鉴于我们是使用家畜不食用的部分来制造乙醇燃料的,那么家畜可使用的饲料 不会减 少。<br>第三,在未来,乙醇燃料可以在价格上同汽油竞争的。确实,现在政府的补贴政策使得乙 醇 燃料的价格比实际要低,但是这样的补贴政策不需要一直存在。一点有足够多的人购买乙 醇 燃料燃料,那么乙醇燃料燃料的制造商将会更多地生产。一般来说,对某产品的生产增多会 导致价格下降,所以当乙醇燃料燃料的产量增加之后,价格也会随之下降。研究表明如果乙 醇 燃料燃料产品的产量增加三倍,那么每个单位乙醇燃料燃料的价格将会下降 40%。</p>

<p>Genetic modification, a process used to change an organism’s genes and hence its characteristics, is not being used to improve trees. Through genetic modification, it is possible to create trees that produce more fruit, grow faster, or withstand adverse conditions. Planting genetically modified trees on a large scale promises to bring a number of benefits.</p>
<p>First, genetically modified trees are designed to be hardier than nature trees; that it, they are more likely to survive than their unmodified counterparts. In Hawaii, for example, a new pest-resistant species of papaya tree has been developed in response to ring-spot virus infections that have repeatedly damaged the native papaya-tree population. Planting the genetically modified papayas has largely put an end to the ring-spot problem.<br>Moreover, genetically modified trees promise to bring a number of economic benefits to those who grow them. Genetically modified trees tend to grow faster, give greater yields – of food, fruit, or other products – and be hardier. This allows tree farmers to get faster and greater returns on their farming investment and save on pesticides as well.</p>
<p>Finally, the use of genetically modified trees can prevent overexploitation of wild trees. Because of the growing demand for firewood or building timber, many forests around the world are being cut down faster than they can be replaced. Introducing genetically modified trees – designed for fast growth and high yield in given geographic conditions – would satisfy the demand for wood in many of those areas and save the endangered native trees, which often include unique or rare species.</p>

<p>Genetically modified trees promise to bring a number of economic benefits to those who grow them.</p>

</ul>
<p>Sure, there is benefit to planting genetically modified trees, but are these trees really as great as they first sound? When you examine the subjects closely, there are some serious problems and causes associated with the using of genetic modified trees.</p>
<p>First, genetically modified trees may be resistant to one particular condition, but it doesn’t necessarily ensure their survival. You see: a typical non-modified tree population is genetically diverse. That means that for most threatening conditions, for climate, insects, and pests, whatever, there will be at least some individual trees of any given species tree that are resistant. So, even if the most of one kind of tree were killed, those few resistant ones will survive and ensure the survival of that species of tree. But, genetically modified trees are genetically much more uniform, so if there is supposed to an environmental challenge they have not been designed for, they will all die. So, if the climate changes or new pest engages in, the genetically modified trees will likely be completely wagged out.</p>
<p>That is the second point. There are hidden causes associated with the growing genetically modified trees. You see, the company that genetically modified tree can charge tree farmers much more for its seeds than unmodified tree seeds would cost. Also, after you’ve grown the tree, you can not just collect the seeds and plant the new tree for free. By law, you have to pay the company every time you plant.</p>
<p>And finally, genetically modified trees might actually cause even more damage to the local wild trees. You see, genetically modified trees often grow more aggressively than natural trees do. And genetically modified trees are typically planted among natural trees. As a result, the genetically modified trees out compete the native trees for resources: sunlight, soil nutrition and water. Eventually, crowd out the nature trees.</p>

<p>当然,种植基因改良树木是有好处的,但是真的有利到可以作为首选作物吗?当你仔细<br>审视 这些理由的时候,就会发现基因改良树木会带来一些严重的问题。 首先,基因改良树木可能对某种特定问题有抵抗力,但是这却不足以保证它们的生存。<br>你看, 非基因改良的树木种群是具有基因多样性的。这就意味着无论何种树木,即便是在遭遇 极端 气候灾害或者虫害的情况下,都至少有部分个体对灾害有抵抗能力。所以,即便种群中的 大 多数都死亡了,那么少数有抵抗力的存活下来也能保证这个种群的延续。但是对于基因改<br>良 树木基因是一直的,所以当他们受到他们基因设计里不能低于的环境挑战时,他们会全部死 亡。所以,当气候发生变化或者有新的害虫出现,那么基因改良树木就将全部死亡。<br>现在说第二点。在基因改良树木的生长过程中伴随着一些隐含问题。你看,公司都是 以高于 天然种子很多的价格向农民出售基因改良树木种子的。同时,你现在不能再每年收获 之后收 集种子,然后来年免费再种了。因为根据法律规定,你每年都必须向种子公司支付费用。<br>最后,基因改良树木可能会对本土野生树木造成更多的损害。你看,基因改良树木相对 于天 然树木生长的更为迅猛。而且,基因改良树木一般来说跟天然树木是共同生长的。那么 结果 就是,基因改良树木会抢占天然树木的资源,诸如阳光、土壤和水等。慢慢地,基因改良 树木。</p>

<p>In the United States, it had been common practice since the late 1960s not to suppress natural forest fires. The “let it burn” policy assumed that forest fires would burn themselves out quickly, without causing much damage. However, in the summer of 1988, forest fires in Yellowstone, the most famous national park in the country, burned for more than two months and spread over a huge area, encompassing more than 800,000 acres. Because of the large scale of the damage, many people called for replacing the “let it burn” policy with a policy of extinguishing forest fires as soon as they appeared. Three kinds of damage caused by the “let it burn” policy were emphasized by critics of the policy.</p>
<p>First, Yellowstone fires cause tremendous damage to the parks trees and other vegetation. When the fires finally died out, nearly one third of Yellowstone’s land had been scorched. Trees were charred and blackened from flames and smoke. Smaller plants were entirely incinerated. What had been a national treasure now seemed like a devastated wasteland.</p>
<p>Second, the park wildlife was affected as well. Large animals like deer and elk were seen fleeing the fire. Many smaller species were probably unable to escape. There was also concern than the destruction of habitats and the disruption of food chains would make it impossible for the animals that survived the fire to return.<br>Third, the fires compromised the value of the park as a tourist attraction, which in turn had negative consequences for the local economy. With several thousand acres of the park engulfed in flames, the tourist season was cut short, and a large number of visitors decided to stay away. Of course, local businesses that depended on park visitors suffered as a result.</p>

<p>在美国,从 1960 年代末开始就非常普遍地对森林大火采取不扑灭的策略。这种“随它<br>燃烧” 的策略认为森林大火可以在不造成太多损失的情况下迅速燃烧完。然后,1988 年发生 在美 国最出名的黄石国家公园的森林大火却整整燃烧了两个月,蔓延了 80 万英亩。鉴于这 次造 成的巨大损失,很多人主张取消“随它燃烧”的策略,转而开始全力扑灭森林大火的策略。 评 论家们提供了三个由“随它燃烧”策略造成的损害来支持自己的观点。</p>
<p>首先,黄石大火给公园里的树木以及其他植物造成了巨大的损失。当火燃尽的时候,黄 石公 园接近三分之一的面积已成焦土。火焰烧焦树木,浓烟熏黑树木。小型植物则被彻底烧 成灰 烬。当看到宝贵的国家财富成为一片荒地的时候,会是何种感觉?<br>第二,公园的野生动物也遭到了伤害。像鹿或者麋鹿这些大型动物在火灾中都逃脱了, 但是 很多小型动物却不能逃脱。同时,大火还破坏了动物的栖息地并打乱了食物链,这使得当 或 在结束之后,逃离的动物也无法回来栖息于此。<br>第三,火灾会降低公园对游客的吸引力,进而对当地的经济造成不良的影响。由于数千 英亩 的土地被火焰吞没,旅游旺季缩短了,而很多游客都会选择放弃游览黄石公园。当地的经 济 对于旅游业依赖很大,自然会受到负面影响。</p>

<p>Actually, fires are natural part of ecological cycle and their role is not just destructive but also creative. That is why the “let it burn” policy is fundamentally a good one, even if it sometimes causes fires of the 1988 Yellowstone fire. Let’s look at what happened after 1988 fire.</p>
<p>First, vegetation. As you might imagine, scorched areas were in time colonized by new plants. As a matter of fact, the plants in Yellowstone became more diverse because the fire created an opportunity for certain plants that could not grow otherwise. For example, areas where the trees have been destroyed by the fire could now be taken over by smaller plants that needed open and shaded space to grow. And another example, seeds of certain plants species won’t germinate unless they’re exposed to very high levels of heat. So, those plants started appearing after the fire as well.</p>
<p>It’s a similar story with the animals. Not only did their populations recover, but the fire also created new opportunities. For instance, the small plants that replaced trees after the fire created an ideal habitat for certain small animals like rabbits and hares. And when rabbits and hares started thriving, so did some predators that depended on them for food. So, certain food chains actually became stronger after the fire than they were before.</p>
<p>And last, fires like 1988 Yellowstone fire would be a problem for tourism if they happened every year. But they don’t. It was a very unusual combination of factors that year, low rainfall, unusually strong winds, accumulation of dry undergrowth that caused fire to be so massive. This combination has not occurred since and Yellowstone has not seen such a fire since 1988. Visitors came back to the park next year and each year after that.</p>

There are reasons to believe that this invasion cannot be stopped and that it poses a serious threat to freshwater fish populations in all of North America.<br>First, the history of the zebra mussel’s spread suggests that the invasion might be unstoppable. It is a prime example of an invasion made possible by human<br>transportation. From the zebra mussel，s original habitats in Eastern Europe,<br>ships helped spread it out along new canals built to connect Europe’s waterways. The mussel can attach itself to a ship’ s bottom or can survive in the water— called “ballast water”—that the ship needs to take on to properly balance its cargo. By the early nineteenth century, the mussel had spread to the whole of Europe. It was later carried to the east coast of North America in the ballast water of ships traveling from Europe. The way ships have spread the zebra mussel in the past strongly suggests that the species will soon colonize all of North America.<br>Moreover, once zebra mussels are carried to a new habitat, they can dominate it. They are a hardy species that does well under a variety of conditions, and they have a high rate of reproduction. Most important, however, zebra mussels often have no predators in their new habitats, and species without natural predators are likely to dominate their habitats.<br>Finally, zebra mussels are likely to cause a decline in the overall fish population in habitats where they become dominant. The mussels are plankton eaters, which means that they compete for food with many freshwater fish species.</p>

<p>Contrary to what you just read, there are ways to control the zebra mussel’s spread. What’s more, it is not so clear that the mussel is a serious threat to fish populations.<br>True, the spread of zebra mussels couldn’t be controlled in the past, but that’s because people didn’t have enough knowledge. In fact, there are effective ways to stop ships from carrying the mussels to new locations. Here’s an example. The way zebra mussels usually travel across the ocean is that a ship takes on some fresh “ballast water” in Europe and then empties that water into American waterways when it arrives. Full of zebra mussels, but the ship can be required to empty out the freshwater and refill with ocean water while still out in the ocean. Salt water will kill the mussels.<br>Second, it’s true that zebra mussels often don’t have predators in their new habitats, but that’s only in the beginning. What’s been happening in Europe is that local aquatic birds sooner or later notice there’s a new food source around and change their habits to exploit it. They switch from whatever they were eating before to eating zebra mussels. And birds can eat a lot of mussels. So zebra mussels aren’t so likely to dominate their new habitats after all.<br>Finally, even in habitats where zebra mussels become dominant, is the overall fish population likely to decrease. It’s true that zebra mussels may have a negative impact on fish that eat plankton. But on other fish, they can have a positive impact. For example, the mussels generate nutrients that are eaten by fish that feed near the bottom of the lake or river. So bottom-feeding fish populations may increase, even if plankton-eating fish population decrease.</p>

<li><p>【范文】<br>In the lecture, the professor casts doubt on the reading passage’s idea that zebra mussel poses a serious threat to freshwater fish populations. The professor asserts that zebra mussels are not likely to become a serious threat to freshwater fish populations in North America.<br>Firstly, contrary to the belief in the passage that the invasion might be unstoppable, the professor asserts that new knowledge of the zebra mussel has shed light on new ways to prevent their invasion, even though people in the past have not been able to stop the spread of zebra mussels effectively. For instance, although a large amount of zebra mussels spread to North America by staying in the ballast water of a ship, people can now get rid of them before the ship gets to the shore – if the ballast water is emptied halfway of the journey and refreshed with sea water, the zebra mussels can be exterminated as soon as they get exposed to salt water.<br>Secondly, the author of the passage points out that once zebra mussels are carried to a new habitat, they can dominate it, while the lecture notes that zebra mussels are not likely to dominate a new habitat for a long period of time. The lecture agrees that zebra mussels may have no predators and reproduce rapidly in the beginning, but it would not be long before predators notice this new source of food and therefore prevent its domination.<br>Lastly, opposing the author’s belief that zebra mussels are likely to cause a decline in the overall fish population in habitats, the professor contends that zebra mussels would not cause the decline of overall fish population. While zebra mussels would most likely cause the decline of plankton eaters, as the passage suggests, they would also provide nutrients for bottom-feeding fish and eventually cause the population of those fish to increase.</p>
